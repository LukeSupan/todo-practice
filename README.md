# Basic ToDo list web app
this is for js and command line git practice
i have been crutching on github desktop too heavily. i need to become a keyboard based being.

git bash tests have been good so far! this message was part of one! so. seeing this is good. check out those fancy semantic commit messages (probably wrong. im learning.)

finished this for now. works good. i needed to follow the tutorial more than i wanted for the javascript but this was very helpful overall

ill start on something completely solo soon. it probably wont work half as well as this honestly but. i will learn even more
